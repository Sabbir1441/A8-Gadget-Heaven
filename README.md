## ⚛️ Core React Concepts Used  
This project applies several essential React principles to create a dynamic and user-friendly experience:  

- **Components**: The site is structured with reusable, modular components to ensure scalability and maintainable code.  
- **Props**: Props are used to pass dynamic data between components for seamless rendering.  
- **State Management**: The `useState` and `useContext` hooks are employed to manage the application's dynamic state effectively.  
- **React Router**: Smooth navigation across pages is powered by React Router, enabling a single-page application feel.  
- **Conditional Rendering**: Various elements in the UI, such as the cart and wishlist, are rendered conditionally based on state changes.

## 🛠️ Data Management  
To maintain a consistent state across the application, the **Context API** is implemented for global state management. This approach is particularly useful for features like the cart and wishlist. Additionally, **local storage** integration ensures that user data, such as cart items, remains intact even after refreshing the page.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Interactive Cart and Wishlist**: Add your favorite gadgets to the cart or wishlist, with all changes managed via the Context API for a seamless experience.  
- **Comprehensive Statistics Page**: A dedicated statistics page includes a composed chart, displaying price vs. product name along with ratings as scatter points.  
- **Cart Sorting**: Users can easily sort cart items by price for quick comparison and selection.  
- **Responsive Navbar**: The navigation bar features active link styling, offering a polished and intuitive user experience.  
- **Modern UI Design**: Powered by **Tailwind CSS**, the design maintains a consistent color scheme, sleek layout, and user-friendly interface.
